<h1>Wign</h1>

<h2>A collaboration-based danish sign language encyclopedia</h2>

<p>The idea of Wign is inspired from a post by Kenneth Andersen in a blog of <a href="http://www.ddu.dk">Danish Deaf Youth Association</a> (DDU). Wign is a is about a sign language encyclopedia (not to be confused with dictionary!), which everyone can contribute and share with signs for rarely used terms. A social danish sign language platform very alike Wikipedia.</p>

<h2>Why github?</h2>

<p>The project was run by DDU and <a href="http://www.12k.dk">12K</a>, but failed due to complicated setup and communication issues with the website provider. Now I&rsquo;ve taken over the project, and I will make the code behind the project open source and collaboration-based, as Wign self.</p>

<p>The project is run by voluntary efforts by myself, to contribute to a richer sign language sharing among us danish deaf.</p>

<p><strong>You</strong> are therefore invited to take part in the code and fix out issues and other fuzzies in the codes!</p>
