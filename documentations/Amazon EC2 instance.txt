Setting an Amazon EC2 instance:

/** Setups the Security Groups */
# To accepting inbound HTTP and HTTPS trafics from whole IP range (default)
@ http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html#adding-security-group-rule

/** Log in the instance */

$ sudo yum update -y
# Updates the instance with the newest updates

/** Installing LAMP web server (Apache) */
# Webserver with PHP and mySQL
@ http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/install-LAMP.html

!! Remember to update the php before adding www group and alter the permissions. It installs 5.3 by default.
$ sudo yum remove httpd* php*
$ sudo yum install php55 (or later if it supports it)
